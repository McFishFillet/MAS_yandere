<h4 align="center">COMMISSIONED BY NOROSESJUPITER</h4>


## ⚠️ Important notice (please read!)

This submod is designed to make Monika an yandere, depicting a toxic relationship as can be seen in the anime trope.
It was commissioned by someone, and that was the motivation to make me start this project.
I don't think the actions depicted in the topics are healthy neither do I idealize/romanticize them. 
The commissioner allowed me to make this public, so I decided to make a public and proper release of it.
Download at risk, TRIGGER WARNING: blood, toxic relationship, abusive behaviour.


## 🌟 Features

  * New dialogues
  * New farewells
  * New compliments
